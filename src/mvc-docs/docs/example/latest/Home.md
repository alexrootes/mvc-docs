You've reached the official Wiki for [Fluent NHibernate](http://fluentnhibernate.org).

Fluent NHibernate offers an alternative to NHibernate's standard XML mapping files. Rather than writing XML documents, you write mappings in strongly typed C# code. This allows for easy refactoring, improved readability and more concise code.

If you're new here you'll probably want to read our [[Getting started guide|getting started]].

* [[Fluent mapping]]
* [[Auto mapping]] - where mappings are inferred from the design of your entities
* [[Conventions]]
* Full application configuration with our [[Fluent Configuration API|Fluent configuration]]
* [[Database configuration]] - fluently configure your database in code
* [[Persistence specification testing]] - round-trip testing for your entities
* [[FAQs]]
* [[Release notes]]
